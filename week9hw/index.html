    This assignment was super cool. Never knew how to make generative art before. But not sure I can say I actually know how to make generative art now. The lecture last week I was able to keep up with line by line, but theoretically it's a lot of trial and error for me. I think if I sat down and had something specific I wanted to make, good luck. But if it comes to just throwing some code around like wet clay and seeing where it goes, I can do that.

    First, I'd like to credit the tutorial video I found on youtube that I based by design off of -----> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktPnruyC6cc

    The tutorial was pretty straight forward, but the hardest part for me was getting the colors right. I'm familiar with r,g,b and HSB now, but when I'm typing in numbers to get the color I'm truly just randomly typing in digits and crossing my fingers for a nice outcome.

    The other problem I'm afraid I'm having is comprehension. When I look at the demos and reverse engineer it, it makes sense to me. But as far as starting from scratch, I'm afraid I'm really far from that. There's so many commands that I don't know exist, I'm not sure how to learn it all. It's overwhelming, but I am curious enough that I want to figure it out. As a nft collector and artist, I'd be super fun to make a "art blocks" level generative collection one day like "Chromie Squiggles".
