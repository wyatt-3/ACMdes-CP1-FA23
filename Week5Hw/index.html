    Week 5 Reading Quotes
</p>
<br>
<h1>
    "If graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant.""
</h1>
<p>
    This one really spoke out to me. It's why I decided to get my Masters in Interaction design. I used to come from a design background specializing in marketing and coming up with ideas. Concepting is a timeless skill, but I needed to gain some more tangible skills to increase my creative range.
</p>
<h1>“We are now in transition from an object-oriented to a systems-oriented culture. Here change emanates, not from things, but from the way things are done.”</h1>
<p>As someone who's big into crypto & web3, I couldn't agree more. People that don't understand NFTs just haven't woken up to the new system.</p>
<h1>"We now spend a majority of our time looking at screens instead of paper, and this has created a great need for designers who understand how to design for digital devices."</h1>
<p>I believe digital art in the future will be just as coveted as paper art we all uninimously agree is "art"</p>
<br><br>

<h1>
    "Wanting to work in the intersection between art and code."
</h1>

<p>
    Coding has always fascinated me. Maybe the grass looks greener on the other side, but as a fine arts major this was something I always wished I was good at. Making apps, websites, and even smart contracts would be a dream skillset of mine.
</p>
<h1>
    "The pizza box was a very efficient prototype."
</h1>
<p>
    This sentence made me smile. It shows sometimes you can't over look the simple things. And just because it's simple, doesn't mean it's ineffective. Work smarter not harder.
</p>
<h1>"Interactive computer systems are complex."" </h1>
<p>This is a very underrated sentence. As someone who uses a computer everyday and it still is a magic box to me.</p>
